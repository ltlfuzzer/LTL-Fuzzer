# LTL-Fuzzer 

LTL-Fuzzer is a greybox fuzzer to find violations of arbitrary Linear-time Temporal Logic(LTL) properties. It is built on top of the [AFL](https://lcamtuf.coredump.cx/afl/) fuzzer and involves additional program instrumentation to check if a particular execution trace is accepted by the BÃ¼chi automaton representing the negation of the given LTL property. Our framework takes as input a sequential program written in C/C++, and an LTL property. It finds violations, or counterexample traces, of the LTL property in stateful software systems. 

LTL-Fuzzer substantially extends directed greybox fuzzing to witness arbitrarily complex event orderings. We note that existing directed greybox fuzzing approaches are limited to witnessing reaching a location or witnessing simple event orderings such as crashes or use-after-free. This is the main contribution of our work: algorithms and an implementation
of our ideas in a tool that is able to validate any LTL property, thereby covering a much more expressive class of properties than crashes or use-after-free. Our work adapts directed greybox fuzzing (which directs the search towards specific program locations) to find violations of temporal logic formulae.

# Example Usage

## RERS Example

### Testing Framework Introduction

* The subject under test in RERS19 (http://rers-challenge.org/2020/) is located in:
```
  LTL-Fuzzer/experiment/Problem1/src
```
* All events specified in the subject is stored in the following file:
```
  LTL-Fuzzer/experiment/Problem1/all_event_dir/all_events.txt
```
* Program locations corresponding to events are stored in the following file:
```
  LTL-Fuzzer/experiment/Problem1/target/targets.txt
```
* Instrumented subjects are stored in the following directory:
```
  LTL-Fuzzer/experiment/Problem1/build_dir
```
* The LTL property under check is stored in the following directory:
```
  LTL-Fuzzer/experiment/Problem1/ltl_dir
```
* The fuzzing initial seeds and outputs are stored, respectively:
```
  LTL-Fuzzer/experiment/Problem1/input_folder
  LTL-Fuzzer/experiment/Problem1/output_folder
```

### Preparing for Instrumentation

* Specifying the home directory, e.g., at home dir:
```
  export LTLFuzzer=~/LTL-Fuzzer/
```
* Specifying the subject directory and name under test:
```
  export SUBJECT=$LTLFuzzer"experiment/Problem1/"
  export EXECName=Problem1
```
* Specifying a LTL property to be checked:
```
  export LTL='!(! (true U oU) | (! oU U ((oZ & ! oU) & X (! oU U oP))))'
```

### Starting Instrumentation

* Instrumenting the example subject uploaded in the repo, experiment/Problem1
```
  cd $LTLFuzzer/scripts/
  ./instrument-problem1.sh $SUBJECT/target/targets.txt $SUBJECT/src $SUBJECT/build_dir 
```

### Launching Fuzzing

* Launching a fuzzing campaign. We use the default fuzzing options here, but you could change fuzzing options as the instructions shown in the [Config-Options.md](./Config-Options.md).
```
  cd LTL-Fuzzer/build/src
  ./ltlfuzz 0
```

## Protocol Example

### Testing Framework Introduction

* The testing framework is the same as testing RERS subjects besides one additional fuzzing dictionary file:
```
  LTL-Fuzzer/experiment/testTelnet/telnet.dict
```

### Preparing for Instrumentation

* Specifying the home directory, e.g., at home dir:
```
  export LTLFuzzer=~/LTL-Fuzzer/
```
* Specifying the subject directory and name under test:
```
  export SUBJECT=$LTLFuzzer"experiment/testTelnet/"
  export EXECName=telnet-server.minimal-net
```
* Specifying a LTL property to be checked:
```
  export LTL='!(G((WILL_DISABLED)->(X(G((DO)|(DONT))))))'
```

### Starting Instrumentation

* Instrumenting the example subject uploaded in the repo, experiment/testTelnet
```
  cd $LTLFuzzer/scripts/
  ./instrument-telnet.sh $SUBJECT/targets/targets.txt $SUBJECT/contiki $SUBJECT/build_dir 
```

### Launching Fuzzing

* Launching a fuzzing campaign. We use the default fuzzing options here, but you could change fuzzing options as the instructions shown in the [Config-Options.md](./Config-Options.md).
```
  cd LTL-Fuzzer/build/src
  ./ltlfuzz 1
```
